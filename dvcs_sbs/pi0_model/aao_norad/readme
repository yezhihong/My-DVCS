The input file must have the following format. Please see the script aaorun 
and example input file aao_norad_input.inp included in this package for an 
example of how to run the program:

phys         Physics model: 1=A0, 4=MAID98, 5=MAID2000
flag_ehel    0= no polarized electron, 1=polarized electron
npart        number of particles in BOS banks: 2=(e-,h+), 3=(e-,h+,h0)
epirea       final state hadron: 1=pi0, 3=pi+
ebeam        incident electron beam energy in GeV
q2min q2max  minimum and maximum Q^2 limits in GeV^2
epmin epmax  minimum and maximum scattered electron energy limits in GeV
nmax         number of output events
fmcall       factor to adjust the maximum cross section, used in M.C. selection
boso         1=bos output, 0=no bos output
